0.18 - Thu Mar 25 13:42:00 2010

Bug fixes:

    * The char* allocated by String2Ptr now have a trailing null. I
      noticed that a common strcpy() of my allocated strings pulled in
      random garbage because apparently all my initial work had just
      accidentally worked right.

      Without this bug fix, this can be worked around by appending
      your own null:

          my $ptr = Judy::Mem::String2Ptr( "hello world\0" )

0bc65322391f5a402c7fe523badd9582e51c3405 Add a terminating null to String2Ptr allocated strings
07d1f01575e7e1273c7aca53b618f59d5a35dec9 Remove unused variable from String2Ptr

0.16 - Wed Mar 24 23:10:00 2010

f1a58a728fde2fe568f0d63411fe28af42a8aef7 Use Test::Deep to work-around perl-5.8.7 which would FETCH *many* times against a tied value and would break t/41typemap.t for no good reason

0.15 - Wed Mar 24 21:55:00 2010

322dbba36177b6892511bacf2a93f8c48ab7b773 Inline::C accepts a *string* in TYPEMAP, not array

0.14 - Wed Mar 24 16:25:00 2010

Bug fixes:

* The functions Judy::SL::Get and ::Set were clobbering the
  contents of the index keys. These variables weren't supposed to
  be writable.

  These functions should not be used prior to this release.

* The functions Judy::1::Free, ::NextEmpty, ::LastEmpty, ::PrevEmpty
  all accidentally used the wrong functions for JudyL arrays instead
  of Judy1 arrays. It seems like a copy/paste error.

  These functions should not be used prior to this release.

* My Judy API normally writes the object's pointer to a in/out
  variable. There was a potential memory leak if your original object
  pointer was undef instead of 0. The newly allocated value is now
  mortalized.

  This can be worked around by initializing the Judy object. Do:

      my $judy = 0;
      Set( $judy, ... )

   Instead of:

      my $judy;
      Set( $judy, ... )

* The commit 0f5f24c appears to fix something about lifting undef
  values to real values. I don't recall the substance of what happened
  incorrectly without this.
